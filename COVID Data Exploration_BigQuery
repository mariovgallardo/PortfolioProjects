-- Hello! Below are some of the queries I've written when exploring two publicly available COVID datasets. 

SELECT *
FROM `striking-shadow-385123.COVID_Deaths_and_Vaccinations.COVID_Deaths`
  order by 3,4

SELECT* 
FROM `striking-shadow-385123.COVID_Deaths_and_Vaccinations.COVID_Vaccinations`
  order by 3,4

-- Select Data that we are going to be using 

SELECT Location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
FROM `striking-shadow-385123.COVID_Deaths_and_Vaccinations.COVID_Deaths`
Order by 1,2

-- Looking at Total Cases vs. Total Deaths
-- Shows the likelihood of dying from contracting COVID in your country

SELECT Location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
FROM `striking-shadow-385123.COVID_Deaths_and_Vaccinations.COVID_Deaths`
Where location like "United States"
Order by 1,2

-- Looking at Total Cases vs. Population
-- Shows what percentage of population got COVID 

SELECT Location, date, total_cases, Population, (total_cases/population)*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
FROM `striking-shadow-385123.COVID_Deaths_and_Vaccinations.COVID_Deaths`
Where location like "United States"
Order by 1,2

-- Looking at Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population 

SELECT Location, Population, MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount, 
  MAX((total_cases/population))*100 AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM `striking-shadow-385123.COVID_Deaths_and_Vaccinations.COVID_Deaths`
Group by Location, Population
Order by PercentPopulationInfected desc

-- Looking at Countries with Highest Death Count per Population

SELECT Location, MAX(total_deaths) AS TotalDeathCount
FROM `striking-shadow-385123.COVID_Deaths_and_Vaccinations.COVID_Deaths`
WHERE continent is not null
Group by Location
Order by TotalDeathCount desc

-- Showing the Continents with the highest death count per population

SELECT continent, MAX(cast(total_deaths as INT)) as TotalDeathCount
FROM `striking-shadow-385123.COVID_Deaths_and_Vaccinations.COVID_Deaths`
WHERE continent is not null
Group by continent
Order by TotalDeathCount desc

-- GLOBAL NUMBERS 

SELECT SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as INT)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as INT))/SUM(new_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
FROM `striking-shadow-385123.COVID_Deaths_and_Vaccinations.COVID_Deaths`

From `striking-shadow-385123.COVID_Deaths_and_Vaccinations.COVID_Deaths` as dea
JOIN `striking-shadow-385123.COVID_Deaths_and_Vaccinations.COVID_Vaccinations` as vac
  On dea.location = vac.location
  and dea.date = vac.date

-- Looking at Total Population vs. Vaccination

SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
From `striking-shadow-385123.COVID_Deaths_and_Vaccinations.COVID_Deaths` as dea
